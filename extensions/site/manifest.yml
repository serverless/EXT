    s3BucketName:
      type: string
      description: A custom name for the AWS S3 bucket. Please note that it is recommended to name your bucket as your domain. If you enter a `domain` as part of your configuration, that will be used as the bucket name (this is highly recommended given bucket names are impossible to change later). Otherwise, without a custom name, a randomly generated name will be created.
